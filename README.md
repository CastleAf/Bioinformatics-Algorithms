This repository stores all the programs I've written while attending **Coursera**'s online [Bioinformatics Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/bioinformatics). This specialization focuses on teaching Bioinformatics for both learners with biology or computer science backgrounds. The Honors path (the path I followed) uses an external tool - [Cogniterra](https://cogniterra.org/). This path adds a more in depth explanation of the algorithms and involves a series of exercises to solve by coding.

This specialization is offered by the University of California, San Diego. The courses are taught by Dr. Pavel Pevzner and Dr. Phillip Compeau. The specialization is divided into 7 courses, each focusing on a different aspect of Bioinformatics. There is a big emphasis on algorithms and data structures, as well as the use of Python to solve problems. 

The course is accompanied by a book, [Bioinformatics Algorithms: An Active Learning Approach](http://bioinformaticsalgorithms.com/), which is a great resource to learn more about the topics covered in the course. That is the book I'll be using to study and solve the exercises.
